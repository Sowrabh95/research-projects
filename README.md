The research projects contains end to end development of the models for various industrial use cases.
The data collection, preprocessing was one of the biggest challenges with industries and equipments.
These datasets are collected from the advanced measurement systems such as CMM, VMM, surface testers which work under ultra-micron scales.
The datasets presented here are cleaned with various strategies using MS-excel and Python libraries.
Exploratory data analysis was done to gain insights from the dataset.
Model preparation was done by refering to the research articles, using python libraries like scikit-learn, Tenserflow etc...
The training and testing of the models were done and further followed by hyper-parameter tuning for certain models.
The deployment strategies were adopted as per the requirement of the industry (Local, AWS or Azure)
